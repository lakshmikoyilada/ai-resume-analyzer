## 🧬 System Architecture

User → React Frontend → Express Backend → Python NLP Analyzer → Result to Frontend
                                 ↑
                         MongoDB (stores resumes, scores, feedback)

Frontend: Collects resumes, shows analysis results.

Backend: Manages uploads, triggers analysis, handles users.

Analyzer: Uses spaCy/OpenAI to extract and score.

Database: Stores data for analytics and user history.

## 🔍 How It Works
Upload Resume: User uploads resume (PDF/DOCX).

Pre-processing: Resume is parsed using Python.

NLP Analysis:

Extract name, email, skills, experience.

Compare against job descriptions using cosine similarity.

Score resume based on presence of required sections.

Feedback Engine:

Detect missing keywords or sections.

Suggest layout improvements.

Recommendations:

Match with available job listings (from DB or API).

Frontend View:

Dashboard with resume score, suggestions, and matched jobs.
